## Introduction

Modern technical architectures are complex, with lots of layers and interdependencies. Because of this complexity, it can be hard for teams to fully understand the impact of an incident on a single service. 

Service Graph gives your teams a holistic view of your ecosystem without you having to draw it on the whiteboard.

Connect services to other resources they consume, and the resources that consume them. Build out the full system diagram using dependency relationships so all of your stakeholders can see how one service impacts the entire product.

Business Services place semantic meaning to your ecosystem. Your users don't need to know which backend isn't behaving correctly; they only know which "front door" application they can't access. By creating Business Services and assigning them in the Service Graph, everyone in your organization can quickly see the impact of an incident, no matter how much they know about the architecture of the services.
